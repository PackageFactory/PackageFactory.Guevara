> The next generation Neos CMS interface written in ReactJS with Immutable data structures.


## Features

* Better editing experience for responsive websites.
* Faster load times for the backend.
* No reload constraint for the correct stylesheets on multi-site systems.
* Updated Font-Awesome to v4.5.0 (old icon names are migrated on the fly).


## Installation and usage

1. You need to have latest Neos CMS up & running.

You can use this composer.json for that.
   ```
   {
    "name": "neos/neos-development-distribution",
    "description" : "Neos Development Distribution",
    "license": "GPL-3.0+",
    "support": {
        "email": "hello@neos.io",
        "slack": "http://slack.neos.io/",
        "forum": "https://discuss.neos.io/",
        "wiki": "https://discuss.neos.io/c/the-neos-project/project-documentation",
        "issues": "https://jira.neos.io/browse/NEOS",
        "docs": "http://neos.readthedocs.io/",
        "source": "https://github.com/neos/neos-development-distribution"
    },
    "config": {
        "vendor-dir": "Packages/Libraries",
        "bin-dir": "bin"
    },
    "require": {
        "neos/neos-development-collection": "dev-master",
        "neos/flow-development-collection": "dev-master",
        "neos/demo": "dev-master",

        "typo3/party": "dev-master",
        "typo3/neos-seo": "dev-master",
        "typo3/imagine": "dev-master",
        "typo3/twitter-bootstrap": "dev-master",
        "typo3/form": "dev-master",
        "typo3/setup": "dev-master",
        "flowpack/neos-frontendlogin": "dev-master",
        "typo3/buildessentials": "dev-master",
        "mikey179/vfsstream": "~1.6",
        "phpunit/phpunit": "~4.8 || ~5.4.0",
        "symfony/css-selector": "~2.0",
        "flowpack/behat": "dev-master",
        "neos/neos-ui": "dev-master"
    },
    "suggest": {
        "ext-pdo_sqlite": "For running functional tests out-of-the-box this is required"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "post-update-cmd": "TYPO3\\Flow\\Composer\\InstallerScripts::postUpdateAndInstall",
        "post-install-cmd": "TYPO3\\Flow\\Composer\\InstallerScripts::postUpdateAndInstall",
        "post-package-update": "TYPO3\\Flow\\Composer\\InstallerScripts::postPackageUpdateAndInstall",
        "post-package-install": "TYPO3\\Flow\\Composer\\InstallerScripts::postPackageUpdateAndInstall"
    }
}

   ```


2. Run the following commands:
   ```
   composer require neos/neos-ui:dev-master # install our package (you only need this, if you are NOT using the composer.json from above)
   cd Packages/Application/Neos.Neos.Ui
   source Build/init.sh # do NodeJS stuff ie. install required node version using nvm, install npm deps, copy githooks
   npm run build # build everything using webpack (you might see some webpack warnings, but you can ignore them)
   ```

3. Paste the following configuration into the **head** of your global `Routes.yaml` which is located in `Configuration/`
   ```yaml
  -
    name: 'Neos UI'
    uriPattern: '<NeosUiSubroutes>'
    subRoutes:
      'NeosUiSubroutes':
        package: 'Neos.Neos.Ui'
   ```

Now you are all set up and can open the sub-route `/neos!` to login to the new interface.

__Note: We require [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) as well as the `npm` command to be installed on your system.
If you've installed `nvm` make sure that the next node LTS version `6.3.0` is correctly installed - You can do so by executing `nvm install v6.3.0`.
If you need help setting up `nvm`, `npm` or if you got any other problems, join our [Slack](https://neos-project.slack.com/) channel and we are most happy to help you with it. :).__


### Use Docker image

__Alternatively__, instead of doing above setup steps manually, use Docker.
The [million12/neos-react-ui](https://github.com/million12/docker-neos-react-ui)
contains Neos CMS, correct version of NodeJS/nvm and `neos/neos-ui` package
installed and built, working out of the box.

Refer to [million12/neos-react-ui](https://github.com/million12/docker-neos-react-ui)
documentation about how to use it.

#### Development commands
| Command         | Description                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `npm run build` | Builds all assets via webpack. |
| `npm run lint:scripts`  | Lints all `.js` files via ESLint. |
| `npm run lint:css`  | Lints all `.css` files via StyleLint. |
| `npm run lint`  | Runs the above stated watch commands sequentially. |
| `npm run karma` | Executes a single run of all unit tests via karma. (This is pretty slow due to webpack's single-compilation speed, use the `watch:karma` task instead for development) |
| `npm run watch:build`  | Watches all source files and rebuilds the compiled files on file changes. |
| `npm run watch:karma`  | Watches all source files and unit test specs and runs karma after the compilation has been completed. |
| `npm run watch`  | Runs the above stated watch commands sequentially. |
| `npm test`  | Executes both `npm run lint` and `npm run karma` sequentially. |

#### Code style
Our code style is based upon `xo`, with one big difference - We use 4 spaces instead of tabs, to align our code style a bit with the PSR-2 standard for our PHP codebase. To lint the code, execute `npm run lint` in your shell.

#### Writing unit tests
The unit tests are executed with Karma and PhantomJS.
Instead of relying on the default settings of Karma, we use [chai](http://chaijs.com/) as our assertion library and
[sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) for spies. To run the unit tests, execute `npm run karma` in your shell.

Adding unit tests is fairly simple, just create a file on the same tree level as your changed/new feature, named `[filename].spec.js` and karma will execute all tests found within the spec file, other than that, just orient yourself on the existing tests.

Use `it.only(() => {})` and `describe.only(() => {})` if you want to run a specific test and not the whole test suite.
