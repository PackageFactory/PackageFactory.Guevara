## Features
* Better editing experience for responsive websites.
* Faster load times for the backend.
* No reload constraint for the correct stylesheets on multi-site systems.
* Updated Font-Awesome to v4.5.0 (old icon names are migrated on the fly).

## Installation
*Composer support coming soon...*

Clone the repository into your Neos `Packages/Application/` folder, delete the default flowpack Neos login package from the `Packages/Plugins` directory
and paste the following configuration into the head of your global `Routes.yaml` which is located in `Configuration/`.
```yaml
-
  name: 'PackageFactory Guevara'
  uriPattern: '<GuevaraSubroutes>'
  subRoutes:
    'GuevaraSubroutes':
      package: 'PackageFactory.Guevara'
```

Afterwards open the sub-route `/che!` to login to the new interface.
