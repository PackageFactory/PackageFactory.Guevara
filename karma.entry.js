//
// This file serves as the main entry file for karma.
// It will require all files ending with `.spec.js`
// and compiles them with webpack on the fly.
//
// The regular configuration for karma generates a webpack bundle for each test spec,
// this would result in a lot of big compiled files which need to be compibled indepedently.
//
// Instead, this way of requiring all spec files results in one big test bundle webpack
// needs to compile, which is a lot faster than the default configuration.
